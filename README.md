# SQL-Challenge-Answers
## The sakila, world, and movielens SQL files for the challenge as set for my QA training

**NOTE:**
All three answer files create views for all task answers, and the full script is uploaded in the answer files rather than just the output or answers. At the bottom of each file below a comment line " -- END OF *name* CHALLENGE SCRIPT -- you will find the "SELECT * FROM *view*" commands for each tasks view and can just run this if you're not interested in viewing the whole scrip.  
  Otherwise, hope you have a lovely day and don't hesitate to let me know if there are any isues accessing the files.  
  Thanks,  
  Emily Bradfield
